Investment: Putting money into different channels like stocks, bonds, real estate, etc., seeking higher returns but accompanied by certain risks.

3. What are Stocks?

4. Why Do Companies Issue Stocks?
Companies issue stocks to raise funds to support their operations, expansion, or other financial needs.

5. How are Stocks Traded?
Stocks are typically traded on stock exchanges.

6. How to Evaluate Stocks?
Investors use various methods to assess the value of stocks, including fundamental analysis and technical analysis. Fundamental analysis involves evaluating a company's financial situation and market prospects, while technical analysis focuses on charts and historical data of stock prices.

7. How to Manage Risk in Investing?

8. Investment Strategy:
Long-term Investment vs Short-term Trading: Long-term investment usually involves holding an investment for many years, while short-term trading might involve buying and selling within days or weeks.

9. Why Diversify Investments?
Diversification means not putting all your money into the same type of asset, which can help reduce risk. If one investment fails, others might still yield returns, thereby offsetting the loss.

10. Relationship Between Risk and Return
Generally, the higher the risk, the higher the potential return. But this also means a greater possibility of losing money. Therefore, choose investments based on your risk tolerance.

11. Interesting Knowledge: Loss Aversion
Loss aversion is a core concept in behavioral economics, referring to people's desire to avoid losses exceeding their satisfaction from gaining an equivalent amount. Investors may be reluctant to sell loss-making stocks, hoping they will recover to the purchase price or become profitable, even when better investment opportunities are available. This behavior can lead to investors taking on greater risks, holding onto poorly performing assets for the long term. Conversely, loss aversion can also cause investors to be too eager to realize profits, potentially selling profitable stocks too early and missing out on greater growth opportunities.
